# Project: Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and related algorithms. It demonstrates concepts like linked lists, queues, heaps, and their real-world applications. The code is designed to be modular, reusable, and easy to understand for educational purposes.

---

## Files Overview

### 1. **Heap.java**
- Implements a heap data structure.
- Features include:
  - Insert operations.
  - Extracting the maximum or minimum.
  - Heapify operations.

### 2. **LinkedList.java**
- Implements a singly linked list.
- Features include:
  - Adding and removing elements.
  - Traversing the list.

### 3. **ListIterator.java**
- Provides an iterator for the linked list.
- Allows traversal and modification of the linked list using an iterator design pattern.

### 4. **Main.java**
- The entry point of the application.
- Demonstrates the usage of the various data structures implemented in the repository.

### 5. **Manager.java**
- Coordinates and manages the interaction between different data structures.
- May include logic to combine or manipulate data between structures.

### 6. **Node.java**
- Represents a single node used in data structures like linked lists.
- Stores data and a reference to the next node.

### 7. **Patient.java**
- A class to represent patients in a healthcare-related context.
- Likely used in conjunction with data structures (e.g., queue) to simulate real-world scenarios.

### 8. **Queue.java**
- Implements a queue data structure.
- Features include:
  - Enqueue and dequeue operations.
  - Checking if the queue is empty.
